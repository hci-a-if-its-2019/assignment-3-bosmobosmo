# Usability Evaluation and Prototyping
> Usability Evaluation in this assignment is to evaluate your high-fidelity interactive-prototype with two participants:
> the participant from the previous Contextual Inquiry (CI) 
> and an additional novice-participant with different demographics if possible.
> Respectively, revise your prototype as an attempt to fix any problems found in this Usability Evaluation.

## Part A: Usability Evaluation

### 1. Brief Description of Participants

#### a. Description of Participant 1
 - Previous CI participant
 - Around 20 years old
 - Currently a college student
 - Male
 - Uses internet mostly to browse, social media, and gaming

#### b. Description of Participant 2
Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.

### 2. Evaluation Script
 - Just interact with the prototype and tells me what you think about it

### 3. Transcript

#### a. Transcript with Participant 1
```
1.  A: Jadi nanti kamu coba terus komentarmu gimana.
2.  B: Kok nggak bisa di-scroll?
3.  A: Nggak bisa soalnya aku cuma bikin segitu aja.
4.  B: *clicks the search button*
5.  B: Udah?
6.  A: Lanjutin sekarang searh resultnya.
7.  B: *clicks the search result.
8.  B: Ini kalo divisit apa langsung ke web aslinya?
9.  A: Enggak. Cuma gambar ini.
10. B: Oalah. Iya ya.
11. A: Kalo diklik search button balik ke yang tadi lagi.
12. B: Terus ngapain sekarang?
13. A: Liat tampilannya terus komentarmu gimana. Susahnya dimana.
14. B: Menurutku gampang soalnya hasilnya langsung keluar.
15. B: Kurangnya menurutku di search result nggak ada sinopsisnya.

#### b. Transcript with Participant 2
 - **00:01** 👨‍🔬 You: Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
 - **00:10** 👨‍💻 Participant: Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s.
 - **00:17** 👨‍🔬 You: when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
 - **00:25** 👨‍💻 Participant: The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog.

### 4. Feedback and Incidence Analysis
> Record your observations per prototype screen followed by reference, feedback, incidence, reason, and resolution.

#### OBSERVATION 1
![Prototype Screen 1](https://www.europassitalian.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/bravolol-app-screenshot-1-635x1128.png)

 - **Reference**: Provide line-number(s) or time-code(s) referred by feedback/incidence observed on the screen.
 - **Feedback**: Provide feedback (positive or negative) given by the participants, if any.
 - **Incidence**: Critical incidences (breakdowns or problems encountered by the participants) and/or mistakes committed by the participants, if any.
 - **Reason**: Explain the reason for the breakdowns or the negative feedback observed on the screen.
 - **Resolution**: Suggest any modifications that might be made to the UI to address the issues in this `OBSERVATION 1`.
 
#### OBSERVATION 2
![Prototype Screen 2](https://www.studiainitalia.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/free-courses-Learn-Italian-Online.jpg)

 - **Reference**: 
 - **Feedback**: 
 - **Incidence**: 
 - **Reason**: 
 - **Resolution**: Suggest any modifications that might be made to the UI to address the issues in this `OBSERVATION 2`.
 
#### OBSERVATION 3
